* through this PA, I was supposed to learn how to use functions to make coding easier and less redundant. The key concept I explored was using functions and figuring out how they work and how to implement them. My results did match what I expected to get. The challenge I encountered was understanding the functions because I understood the examples but once I went to use them on my own they became very confusing. To overcome this, I looked at the examples we did in class and the functions used in lab 6 to see what they should look like. My key takeaway is that functions make a complex code simpler. I do think I learned what I was supposed to learn in this lab ebcause now I have a much better understansing of what functions are and how to use them.
